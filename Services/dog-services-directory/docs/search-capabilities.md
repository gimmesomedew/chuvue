# Dog Services Directory - Search Capabilities

## Overview

The Dog Services Directory features a **comprehensive, natural language search system** that can interpret various types of user queries and return relevant results. This is now the **DEFAULT and ACTIVE search system** for the application.

## 🎯 Current Status

**✅ ACTIVE**: This search system is now the **default search** for the Dog Services Directory  
**🚫 DEPRECATED**: The old complex search system has been replaced  
**📅 Migration Date**: December 2024

## Search Architecture

### Backend Components
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/search-simple` - Main search processing endpoint
- **Query Parser**: Rule-based natural language processing
- **Location Resolver**: Handles geolocation, geocoding, and reverse geocoding
- **Database Integration**: Direct Supabase queries with spatial search capabilities

### Frontend Components
- **Search Form**: Simplified search input with real-time processing
- **Results Display**: Grid layout with distance information and filtering
- **Location Services**: GPS integration for proximity searches

## Supported Search Types

### 1. Service Type Searches

The system **dynamically detects service types** by querying the `service_definitions` table in real-time, ensuring all available services in your database are searchable.

#### Dynamic Service Type Detection:
- **Queries the database** for all available service types
- **Matches service names** and variations automatically
- **Includes synonyms and common terms** for each service type
- **Fallback protection** if database query fails

#### How It Works:
1. **API queries `service_definitions` table** on each search
2. **Compares search query** against all `service_name` and `service_type` fields
3. **Matches variations** (e.g., "grooming" matches "groomer")
4. **Returns appropriate service type** for database filtering

#### Common Service Types (examples from typical databases):
- **Dog Parks**: Keywords like "dog park", "dogpark", "park"
- **Groomers**: Keywords like "groomer", "grooming", "pet grooming"
- **Veterinarians**: Keywords like "vet", "veterinarian", "animal hospital"
- **Dog Trainers**: Keywords like "trainer", "training", "dog training"
- **Boarding & Daycare**: Keywords like "boarding", "daycare", "pet sitting"
- **Dog Walkers**: Keywords like "walker", "walking", "dog walking"
- **Pet Sitters**: Keywords like "sitter", "sitting", "pet sitting"
- **Emergency Vets**: Keywords like "emergency", "urgent", "24/7"
- **Holistic Vets**: Keywords like "holistic", "alternative", "natural"
- **Mobile Services**: Keywords like "mobile", "house call", "in-home"

#### Examples:
```
✅ "Dog parks" → Matches any park-related services
✅ "Groomers" → Matches any grooming services
✅ "Emergency vets" → Matches emergency veterinary services
✅ "Mobile grooming" → Matches mobile grooming services
✅ "Holistic veterinarians" → Matches alternative vet services
```

**Note**: The actual service types available depend on what's defined in your `service_definitions` table. The system automatically adapts to your database content.

### 2. Location-Based Searches

#### 2.1 State Searches

Search for services within specific states using full state names or abbreviations. The system supports **all 50 US states plus territories**.

**Comprehensive State Support:**
- **All 50 US States**: From Alabama to Wyoming
- **US Territories**: DC, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands
- **Full State Names**: "California", "New York", "Massachusetts"
- **State Abbreviations**: "CA", "NY", "MA"
- **Case Insensitive**: Works with any capitalization

**State Detection Logic:**
1. **Prioritizes full state names** (more specific)
2. **Falls back to abbreviations** if no full name match
3. **Handles multi-word states** like "New Hampshire", "South Dakota"
4. **Supports territories** and special cases

#### Examples:
```
✅ "Dog parks in California"
✅ "Groomers in New York"
✅ "Vets in TX" (Texas)
✅ "Training in North Carolina"
✅ "Boarding in Washington"
✅ "Services in Alaska"
✅ "Dog parks in Hawaii"
✅ "Vets in Puerto Rico"
✅ "Groomers in Washington DC"
```

**All US States Supported:**
```
AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD,
MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC,
SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY, DC, PR, GU, AS, VI, MP
```

#### 2.2 Zip Code Searches

Search for services within specific zip codes using 5-digit postal codes.

**Detection Patterns:**
- Direct zip codes: Numbers in format `\d{5}`
- Context-aware: "zip", "zipcode", "postal", "code" + numbers

#### Examples:
```
✅ "Dog parks near 46240"
✅ "Groomers close to 46037"
✅ "Vets in 46123"
✅ "Dog parks zip 46220"
✅ "Services postal code 46260"
```

#### 2.3 Proximity Searches ("Near Me")

Search for services near the user's current location using GPS geolocation.

**Supported Proximity Patterns:**

**Direct Location References:**
- "near me"
- "close to me"
- "near my location"
- "close to my location"
- "near my area"
- "in my area"

**General Proximity Indicators:**
- "nearby"
- "close by"
- "around me"
- "around here"
- "in the area"
- "local"
- "locally"

**Contextual Proximity:**
- "that are close"
- "that are near"
- "that are nearby"
- "close to here"
- "near here"

**Distance-Based Indicators:**
- "within driving distance"
- "not far"
- "not too far"
- "walking distance"
- "driving distance"

**Convenience Indicators:**
- "convenient"
- "accessible"

#### Examples:
```
✅ "Dog parks near me"
✅ "Local groomers"
✅ "Dog parks nearby"
✅ "Vets that are close"
✅ "Groomers around here"
✅ "Dog parks within driving distance"
✅ "Convenient dog parks"
```

### 3. Combined Searches

The system can handle queries that combine service types with location specifications.

#### Examples:
```
✅ "Dog parks near me"
✅ "Groomers in Illinois"
✅ "Vets close to 46240"
✅ "Dog training nearby"
✅ "Local boarding services"
✅ "Dog parks in Indiana"
```

## Search Processing Logic

### Query Processing Order

1. **Dynamic Service Definitions Fetch**: Queries `service_definitions` table for all available service types
2. **Service Type Extraction**: Dynamically matches query against database service types and names
3. **Location Type Detection**: Determines the type of location search (state, zip, proximity)
4. **Location Value Extraction**: Gets specific location values (state, zip, etc.)
5. **Database Query Construction**: Builds appropriate Supabase queries with dynamic filters
6. **Result Processing**: Handles sorting, distance calculation, and formatting

### Location Priority Logic

The system processes location queries in this priority order:

1. **Proximity Searches** → Uses GPS + radius search (25 miles)
2. **State Searches** → Filters by state abbreviation
3. **Zip Code Searches** → Filters by exact zip code match
4. **General Searches** → No location filtering (searches all)

## Search Features

### Distance Calculation & Sorting

**For Proximity Searches:**
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- Results sorted by distance (closest first)
- Distance displayed on each result card
- 25-mile default radius
- GPS geolocation required

**For Other Searches:**
- Results sorted alphabetically by name
- No distance calculation needed

### Result Display

**Search Result Cards Include:**
- Service name and description
- Full address information
- Distance (for proximity searches)
- Service type badge
- Verification status
- Action buttons (favorite, contact, etc.)

### Pagination

**Client-Side Pagination:**
- 25 results per page
- All results fetched from API
- Frontend handles pagination slicing
- Smooth page transitions

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Structure

```typescript
// Request Format
{
  query: string,          // User's search query
  userLocation?: {        // Optional for proximity searches
    lat: number,
    lng: number,
    zip: string,
    city: string,
    state: string
  }
}

// Internal Processing (per request)
1. Query service_definitions table for all available service types
2. Dynamic service type matching against query
3. Comprehensive state/location detection
4. Build filtered Supabase query

// Response Format
{
  success: boolean,
  results: Service[],     // Array of matching services with distance if applicable
  metadata: {
    originalQuery: string,
    parsedPattern: {
      serviceType: string | null,
      locationType: 'state' | 'near_me' | 'zip_code' | null,
      locationValue: string | null,
      radius: number | null
    },
    resultCount: number,
    searchType: 'simple' | 'simple_radius',
    filters: {
      serviceType?: string,
      locationType?: string,
      locationValue?: string,
      radius?: number
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Queries

**Dynamic Service Type Discovery:**
```sql
SELECT service_type, service_name FROM service_definitions;
```

**State Searches:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM services 
WHERE service_type = ? AND state = ?
ORDER BY name;
```

**Zip Code Searches:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM services 
WHERE service_type = ? AND zip_code = ?
ORDER BY name;
```

**Proximity Searches:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Get services within radius
SELECT * FROM services_within_radius(lat, lng, radius_miles);

-- Step 2: Filter by service type (if specified)
-- Step 3: Calculate distance for each result
-- Step 4: Sort by distance (closest first)
-- Step 5: Limit to 100 results
```

**General Searches (no location specified):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM services 
WHERE service_type = ?
ORDER BY name;
```

### Geolocation Services

**GPS Integration:**
- HTML5 Geolocation API
- Automatic location permission request
- Fallback to default location (Fishers, IN)

**Reverse Geocoding:**
- Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) API
- Converts GPS coordinates to address
- Provides city, state, and zip code

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **No GPS Permission**: Falls back to default location
2. **No Results Found**: Shows helpful "no results" message
3. **Invalid Zip Code**: Treats as general search
4. **Network Errors**: Shows error message with retry option
5. **Geocoding Failures**: Uses coordinates without address details

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **Location Fallback**: Default to Fishers, IN (39.9568, -86.0075)
- **Search Fallback**: Broadens search if no results found
- **Service Type Fallback**: Searches all services if type not recognized
